    <p>Kamala Surayya (born Kamala; 31 March 1934â€“31 May 2009),
      popularly known by her one-time pen name Madhavikutty and married name Kamala Das, was an Indian poet in English as
      well as an author in Malayalam from Kerala, India. Her popularity in Kerala is based chiefly on her short stories and
      autobiography, while her oeuvre (works) in English, written under the name Kamala Das, is noted for the poems and
      explicit autobiography. She was also a widely read columnist and wrote on diverse topics including women's issues, child care,
      politics among others etc. Her liberal treatment of female sexuality, marked her as an iconoclast in popular culture of her
      generation.[1] On 31 May 2009 , aged 75, she died at a hospital in Pune.[2]

    <p>Kamala Das was born in Punnayurkulam, Ponnani taluk, Malabar District, British India (present-day Thrissur district, Kerala,
      India) on 31 March 1934, to V. M. Nair, a managing editor of the widely circulated Malayalam daily Mathrubhumi, and Nalapat
      Balamani Amma, a renowned Malayali poet. </p>
    <p>She was noted for her many Malayalam short stories as well as many poems written in English.
      Das was also a syndicated columnist. She once claimed that "poetry does not sell in this country [India]",but her
      forthright columns, which sounded off on everything from women's issues and child care to politics, were popular.
      Kamala Das was a confessional poet whose poems have often been considered at par with those of Anne Sexton and Robert Lowell.
      At the age of 42, she published a daring autobiography, My Story; it was originally written in Malayalam (titled Ente Katha) and
      later she translated it into English. Later she admitted that much of the autobiography had fictional elements.

      Kamala Das is essentially known for her bold and frank expression.
      The prominent features of her poetry are an acute obsession with love and the use of confession.
      The main theme of her poetry is based upon freedom, love and protection. She wrote on a diverse range of topics,
      often disparate- from the story of a poor old servant, about the sexual disposition of upper-middle-class women living near a
      metropolitan city or in the middle of the ghetto. Some of her better-known stories include Pakshiyude Manam, Neypayasam,
      Thanuppu, and Chandana Marangal. She wrote a few novels, out of which Neermathalam Pootha Kalam, which was received favourably
      by the reading public as well as the critics, stands out. She has also held positions as Vice-chairperson in Kerala Sahitya
      Akademi, chairperson in Kerala Forestry Board, President of the Kerala Children's Film Society, editor of Poet magazine and
      Poetry editor of Illustrated Weekly of India.
